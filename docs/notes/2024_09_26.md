- **The next steps of development in order:**
  - Finish VAD. (done)
  - Add the Goodbye state. (done)
  - Evaluate the Demonstrator locally using the WER and RTF. (done)
  - Migrate the implementation to a client-server setup. (done)
  - Evaluate the Demonstrator in the client-server setup using the WER and RTF (including large ASR model). (done)
  - Implement and evaluate alternative TTS models (done)
  - Research existing models/implementations for gamification purposes, such as models for recognizing emotion, age, or dialect in (Dutch) speech.
  - Implement gamification of the Demonstrator.
- When people approach the Demonstrator's setup, the Demonstrator should initiate a conversation. The Demonstrator could start with a greeting or initiate the game it is programmed to play. After initiation, the Demonstrator will listen to what the user has to say.
- The Demonstrator should have a "Goodbye" State where it finishes a conversation by telling a user goodbye, so that the user knows that their conversation with the Demonstrator has finished. This state can be reached when:
  - The Demonstrator has had 3 full rounds of conversation with the end user.
  - The Demonstrator hears a (very) long pause when listening.
