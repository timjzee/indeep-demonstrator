- The process of setting up an independent container in Lightning is a difficult process, but we could also place the Demonstrator as a container in Incus, where other Docker containers of the CLS reside. I could create the Dockerfile that defines the Docker image and send that to Maarten, he can then build the image in Incus. This process is a lot easier and the Demonstrator will reside in the same place as the CLS ASR service, for example.
