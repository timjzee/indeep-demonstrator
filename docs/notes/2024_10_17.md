# Extra ideas for conversations
- If the user does not react to something that the Demonstrator has said, then after a long waiting period, such as 5 seconds, the Demonstrator could start speaking by itself again. For example, it could repeat what it had said before the silence.
  - This can be considered as a new program state called the "PickUp" state, as it "picks up the conversation" again.
  - The "PickUp" state can only be reached via the "Listen" state, after the "Speak" state has occurred at least once in an active conversation.
  - In the "PickUp" state, the Demonstrator continues the conversation (e.g. by repeating itself), after which it moves back to the "Listen" state. If the end user then still remains silent for an even longer amount of time, the Demonstrator goes back to the "PickUp" state again.
    - When leaving the "PickUp" state for a second time in a turn, if the end user still remains silent, when the Demonstrator enters the "MoveOn" state, where it tells the user that it will "move on" from this turn for now (e.g. by saying "Laten we voor nu maar naar de volgende vraag gaan."). This counts as finishing a turn for the model, which then begins with a new turn/question.
- Using the playsound package instead of pydub may lead to more natural conversations, since playsound can play the TTS utterance while listening to user input.
